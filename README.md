# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

'Fraud' in credit card transactions is unauthorized and unwanted usage of an account by someone other than the owner of that account. Necessary prevention measures can be taken to stop this abuse and the behaviour of such fraudulent
practices can be studied to minimize it and protect against similar occurrences in the future. In other words, Credit Card Fraud can be defined as a case where a person uses someone elseâ€™s credit card for personal reasons while the owner and the card issuing authorities are unaware of the fact that the card is being used. Fraud detection involves monitoring the activities of populations of users in order to estimate, perceive or avoid objectionable behaviour, which consist of fraud, intrusion, and defaulting.
